In this project, we will be using **Regression backward selection** for our analysis. The label for our data will be the rating.

```{r}
## first the imports
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(GGally)
```

We need to first check to see if there's actually a linear relationship between the feature and labels.

```{r}
performance <- read_csv('../data/performance.csv')
glimpse(performance)
```
